<h3>View settings:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Query Settings</strong> (These decide which YQL table to query)
    <ul>
      <li>Alternate API URL: <em>default/leave empty</em> (No need to query outside the YQL base)</li>
      <li>API method: JSON (For now the only supported method)</li>
      <li>YQL base table: local.search (The table name is found in the YQL Console)</li>
      <li>Number of items: 30 (Pick a number that covers your needs, but don't fetch the entire table)
      <li>Custom open tables: <em>leave empty</em> (The table is Yahoo's own, so we need no custom open tables)</li>
      <li>YQL base object: <em>leave empty</em> (It could also be set to 'Result' -- the object that contains the results)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Fields</strong> (The available field names can be seen in the YQL Console)
    <ul>
      <li>Field Name: Title</li>
      <li>Field Name: Address</li>
      <li>Field Name: Rating.AverageRating</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Filter</strong> (Again, available fields for filtering can be seen in the YQL Console)
    <ul>
      <li>Field Name: query, Operator: is equal to, Value: sushi</li>
      <li>Field Name: location, Operator: is equal to, Value: san fransisco, ca</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Sort criteria</strong> (Again, available fields for filtering can be seen in the YQL Console)
    <ul>
      <li>Field Name: Rating.AverageRating, Sort descending (Used in the installed example view but not in the screenshot)gi</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
